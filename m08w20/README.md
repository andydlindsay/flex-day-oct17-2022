### To Do
- [x] Tools for testing React
- [x] Coverage Reports
- [x] Add Features/Tests to our App

### Types of Testing
* static - testing your code as it's written (linter)
* manual - the dev is running the code
* unit testing - testing the smallest pieces of our code (functions)
* integration - testing pieces working together
* end-to-end - testing the app like a user (user stories)
* functional testing
* a/b testing
* regression

* Quality Assurance (QA)
